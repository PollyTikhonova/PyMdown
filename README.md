# Mdown
Mdown is CLI tool to convert or even batch convert markdown files to HTML. It can also accept a file stream.  It was inspired by https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview.

# Status
This is in an Alpha state, though it is very useable.  Because of the Alpha state, things are in flux and are subject to change without warning.

# Features
- Python 2 and 3 compatible (but executables built with Python 2 using Pyinstaller)
- Should run on OSX, Windows, and Linux
- Receive multiple files or file patterns to process
- Receive input file stream for conversion
- Configurable options file to tweak Python's Markdown package behavior
- Uses Pygments for syntax highighlighting or optionally highlight.js
- Repo includes in `extras` a simple Sublime Text plugin to stream your files to mdown
- Preview option to open output in a browser intead
- Optionally all the default Markdown extensions, plus these optional mdownx extensions:
    - **absolutepath**: Converts local file paths from relative to absolute for things like links, images, etc.  This is automatically done on all previews.  It can be configured to run all the time outside of previews in the settings file, and it can take a hardcoded path `absolutepath(base_path=/my/path)` or a dynamic path `absolutepath(base_path=${BASE_PATH})` that can take the base\_path fed in on the command line or calculated from the source files path.  If you set this in the settings file, keep in mind the settings file overrides preview's settings.
    - **b64**: Base64 encode local image files. If can be enabled and configured in the settings file and can take a hardcoded path `b64(base_path=/my/path)` or it can take a dynamic base\_path `b64(base_path=${BASE_PATH})` fed in on the command line or calculated from the source files path.
    - **insert**: Add <ins>test</ins> tags by using ++test++. Can be enabled in the settings file.
    - **delete**: Add <del>test</del> tags by using ~~test~~. Can be enabled in the settings file.
    - **magiclink**: Search for and convert http or ftp links to actual HTML links for lazy link creation. Can be enabled in the settings file.
    - **tasklist**: This adds support for github style tasklists.  Can be enabled in the settings.
    - **githubemoji**: This adds emojis.  Assets link to github's emoji icons.  Can be enabled in the settings.
    - **critic**: Cannot be set in the settings file. It is configured automatically, and can only its behaviour can only be modifid via the command line.  In its current form, it can output in HTML a highlighted critic form to make it more readable using the -c option (maybe in the future it might be able to do more).  The automatic behaviour is to strip out critic marks when outputting HTML.  It either accepts all changes or rejects all changes (by default it accepts, but with the -r option it can reject instead).

    - **mdownx**: currently loads insert, delete, b64, tasklist, githubemoji, and magiclink

# Styles and Configuration

## Syntax Highlighting with Pygments
Syntax highlighting can be done in fenced blocks when enabling the `codehilite` extension.  Its styles etc. can be configured in the settings file as well. Here is an example:

```javascript
    "extensions": [
        "extra",
        "toc",
        "codehilite(guess_lang=False,pygments_style=tomorrownighteighties)"
    ]
```

Notice the syntax style is set with the `pygments_style` key.

## How To Use highlight.js Syntax Highlighting
Highlight.js is built in. Use the following settings to enable and control it.

```javascript
    // Use highlight.js instead of pygments
    "highlight_js": false,

    // Select highlight js theme
    "highlight_js_theme": "default",

    // Do not try and guess the language.
    // Only look for fenced blocks where the language
    // is expressly defined
    "highlight_js_noguess": true
```

# Add More CSS and JS Files
Add them to the provided settings:

```javascript
    // Select your CSS for you output html
    // or you can have it all contained in your HTML template
    //
    // Can be an array of stylesheets or "default"
    // "default" can also be an entry in the array.
    // If it points to a physical file, it will be included.
    "css_style_sheets": ["default"],

    // Load up js scripts
    //
    // Can be an array of scripts.
    // If it points to a physical file, it will be included.
    "js_scripts": [],
```

## Change the HTML Template
This can be done here:

```javascript
    // Your HTML template
    "html_template": "default",
```

# Sublime Plugin
Generally I recommend https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview.  But I wrote this program and this sublime plugin to gain certain control I didn't already have.  If for whatever reason you want to use this plugin, this is how you set it up.

Just drop the extra folder in your Sublime `Packages` folder and name to something sane like `mdown`.  It currently provides only 4 commands that are accessible from the command palette:

```javascript
    //////////////////////////////////
    // Mdown
    //////////////////////////////////

    // Preview the current mardown view in your browser
    {
        "caption": "Mdown: Preview Markdown",
        "command": "mdown_preview"
    },

    // Preview the current markdown source in a special
    // mode that highlights critc syntax in a easier to
    // read way.
    {
        "caption": "Mdown: Preview Critic",
        "command": "mdown_critic_preview"
    },

    // Strip out critic markup in your current view
    // favoring the suggested changes
    {
        "caption": "Mdown: Critic Strip Markdown (accept)",
        "command": "mdown_critic_strip"
    },

    // Strip out the critic markup in your current view
    // rejecting the suggested changes
    {
        "caption": "Mdown: Critic Strip Markdown (reject)",
        "command": "mdown_critic_strip",
        "args": {"reject": true}
    }
```


# Credits
- Uses a slightly modified https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown
- Uses the development branch of Pygments for Python 3 supporthttp://pygments.org/
- Borrowed and modified default CSS file from https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview.  Also, the original inspiration for this project.
- Includes Tomorrow Themes for Pygment from https://github.com/MozMorris/tomorrow-pygments

# Build
- Download or clone Pyinstaller main branch (latest release won't work; the dev branch is needed) from github into the mdown project folder https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller
- Using Python 2 run `python build.py -c`
- Binary will be in the `mdown/dist` folder

# TODO
- [X] Critic markup
    - [X] Allow for easy optional visual of critic markup in HTML
    - [X] When normal parsing of a file with critic markup:
        - [X] Remove comments
        - [X] ignore marks
        - [X] don't show removed
        - [X] show inserts as normal
        - [X] substitute is converted to show just the inserts
    - [X] Allow a reject option parse a file with critic markup in the reverse:
        - [X] Remove comments
        - [X] ignore marks
        - [X] don't show added
        - [X] show removed as normal
        - [X] substitute is converted to show just the removed
    - [X] Front in preprocessor in CLI to dump the markdown without crtic marks if desired
- [X] Tasklist (like github's)
- [X] Github Emoji (just link the images to github's assets)
- [X] Better highlight.js support
- [X] Option in binary to show licenses
- [ ] Maybe a better batch output file pattern system
- [ ] Maybe inject javascript into current test documents to verify certain expected things are in output HTML
- ...stuff I havn't yet thought of...
