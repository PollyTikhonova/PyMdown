# Mdown
Mdown is CLI tool to convert or even batch convert markdown files to HTML. It can also accept a file stream.

# Status
This is in an Alpha state, though it is very useable.  Because of the Alpha state, things are in flux and are subject to change without warning.

# Features
- Python 2 and 3 compatible (but executables built with Python 2 using Pyinstaller)
- Should run on OSX, Windows, and Linux
- Receive multiple files or file patterns to process
- Receive input file stream for conversion
- Configurable options file to tweak Python's Markdown package behavior
- Uses Pygments for syntax highighlighting or optionally highlight.js (you must provide highlight.js and highlight.js theme)
- Repo includes in `extras` a simple Sublime Text plugin to stream your files to mdown
- Preview option to open output in a browser intead
- Optionally all the default Markdown extensions, plus these optional mdownx extensions:
    - **absolutepath**: convert local file paths from relative to absolute
    - **b64**: base64 encode local image files
    - **insert**: add <ins>test</ins> tags by using ++test++
    - **delete**: add <del>test</del> tags by using ~~test~~
    - **magiclink**: search for and convert http or ftp links to actual HTML links for lazy link creation
    - **critic**: experimental extension to display a file marked up with critic tags in a more simple way. (this is extension is auto configured internally and is invoked by using -c to view)

        insert, delete, and substitution

    - **mdownx**: currently loads insert, delete, b64, and magiclink

# Credits
- Uses a slightly modified https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown
- Uses the development branch of Pygments for Python 3 supporthttp://pygments.org/
- Borrowed and modified default CSS file from https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview
- Includes Tomorrow Themes for Pygment from https://github.com/MozMorris/tomorrow-pygments

# Build
- Download or clone Pyinstaller main branch (latest release won't work; the dev branch is needed) from github into the mdown project folder https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller
- Using Python 2 run `python build.py -c`
- Binary will be in the `mdown/dist` folder

# TODO
- Critic markup
    - ~~Allow for easy optional visual of critic markup in HTML~~
    - ~~When normal parsing of a file with critic markup:~~
        - ~~Remove comments~~
        - ~~ignore marks~~
        - ~~don't show removed~~
        - ~~show inserts as normal~~
        - ~~substitute is converted to show just the inserts~~
    - Front in preprocessor in CLI to dump the markdown without crtic marks if desired
- Maybe more extensions
- Maybe a better batch output file pattern system
- Maybe inject javascript into current test documents to verify certain expected things are in output HTML
- ...stuff I havn't yet thought of...
