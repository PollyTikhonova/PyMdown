!!! Danger "Under Construction"
    This documentation is currently under construction. And things are subject to change.

# Overview
PyMdown is a CLI tool to convert or even batch convert Markdown files to HTML.  It can also generate HTML previews of Markdown and auto-open them in a webbrowser. It allows for specifying simple HTML templates for the Markdown where you can include CSS and Javascript.  PyMdown is built on top of [Python Markdown][py_md] and [Pygments][pygments].
