# Overview
InlineHilite extends CodeHilite to add inline code highlighting.  Borrowing from CodeHilite's existing syntax, InlineHilite utilizes the following syntax to insert inline  highlighted code: `` `:::language mycode` `` or `` `#!language mycode` ``.  We will call these specifiers mock shebangs.

When using the colon mock shebang, 3 or more colons can be used.  Mock shebangs must come **immediately** after the opening backtick(s) and must be followed by at least one space.  If you need to escape a mock shebang at the start of a code block, just put a space before it and it will be treated as part of the code.

# Example

```
Here is some code: `#!js function pad(v){return ('0'+v).split('').reverse().splice(0,2).reverse().join('')}`.

The mock shebang will be treated like text here: ` #!js var test = 0; `.
